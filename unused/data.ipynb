If you can\\u2019t find the needed content there, do a quick Google search on the topic and look at the first few links or videos from YouTube. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter checking your notes, there are always office hours. These can be helpful but don\\u2019t wait for the next office hour to continue studying. Proceed to the next steps, and you may answer your own questions or have more to ask, making your time spent with your professor more useful.\",\n",

This circadian rhythm helps maintain the normal cycles and functions of your body.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it's working well, your metabolism, energy levels, and cognitive abilities are all operating within their usual range. However, when it's thrown off, you feel...pretty terrible. Jet lag is an example of your circadian rhythm being disrupted: think of how tired and rundown you are after stepping off a long flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate night snacking can have the same effects. While the occasional midnight munch won't have too many ill effects, over time, habitually eating at night will change your body's circadian rhythm as it tries to adapt or work around an unusual activity. Your body wants to eat during the day and sleep at night, not the other way around!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article has more details about late night snacks and your circadian rhythm: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/midnight-snacking-bad-your-brain-180954295/\",\n",

When you take a nap too late in the day you will feel less tired at night and you might not be able to fall asleep. Once you are sleeping more consistently, you likely won't need to nap at all, but things happen and you might not get your beauty sleep every night, in that case, a few naps every now and then won't hurt. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly nap if you are feeling like you did not get an adequate amount of sleep, which is called paying back your sleep debt. A great way to counter sleep debt is to nap at midday. The best hours to do this is between 11 am and 3 pm. This will catch you up on some of your sleep debt without messing up your sleep schedule. This YouTube video goes into detail about it: \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTw0lbShnMA&feature=youtu.be\",\n",

For the longest time, I believed this too. My breaks were filled with hanging out with friends and playing video games into the early hours of the morning. However, as I got older and life became more serious, I noticed a trend. When school would resume, I would find doing work to take way more effort than before. The work ethic habits I had painstakingly created over the last school year had to be made again. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like the deadtime I enjoyed had set my brain into relaxation mode, and it had to be woken up. The summer after my 16th birthday, my parents encouraged me to find a job. Since pizza was my favorite food at the time, I thought it would be fun to get a job at a pizzeria. It was not. However, the transition back into school seemed easier than ever before, and I felt accomplished at the end of the summer. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that summer forward, I made sure to spend my breaks working and learning new skills. While relaxing and having fun is important, deadtime should not be seen as a time to do only that. Rather, deadtime should be seen as the time for opportunity and freedom to push towards dreams and aspirations. If you want to turn deadtime into something productive, great. My plan involves various ways you use deadtime to create good habits, learn new skills, and pursue intriguing interests.\",\n",

      "                            \"description\": \"Making money by taking surveys looks very easy and reliable, but there are some important points that you have to consider before doing this side hustle:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Don\\u2019t use your personal email address to register on these platforms: It is better to create a new email address and use that new email address to sign up on these platforms. Otherwise, you may find these websites constantly spamming your inbox.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Sign up for all of them: If you want to make money by taking surveys, sign up on as many platforms as you can. Many times these platforms won\\u2019t have any available gigs or surveys, but being on multiple platforms make you able to catch more opportunities and do more gigs. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. Quality of your answers matter: Many of these platforms have some form of quality assurance to make sure their members read the survey questions and answer them truthfully. Some of them make you ineligible to receive your money if the quality of your responses is below their standard. So, be honest and answer the surveys carefully. \\r\\n\\r\\n4. Cash in as soon as you can: Many of these platforms let you cash in when you reach a specific limit. For example, if you earn $3 for each survey, they may let you cash in your money in your PayPal account after you reach $20. Don\\u2019t see these platforms as your saving account: always cash in your money immediately and save your money in a secure bank account. \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Scam websites: There are many scam websites out there that advertise easy ways to make money, but they never really pay you anything. It is always a good idea to research and read some reviews about these websites before signing up for them. The websites that I introduced in this action plan received high reviews from the public, but you can also do your own research and read more reviews about each one of these platforms before joining them.\",\n",

Making yourself familiar with the college and the people around you will make you less shy. Also, learn to smile. Make yourself approachable. Ask questions, and don\\u2019t wait for people to talk to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll attributes listed above intertwine to make up one\\u2019s social accountability during the first years of college.

In any interaction, take your time and try to convey your message. You won\\u2019t always be understood, but keep your confidence high and try more. After a few successful interactions, your confidence will boost and you\\u2019ll be comfortable speaking English in any situation.\",\n",

Start off simple: get healthier food choices more often when ordering out. This will help you find things you like and spur you into looking up different recipes and cooking methods.

Keep the following big ideas in mind during this first phase:\\r\\n\\r\\nPurchase frozen meats, vegetables, and other healthier additions to the normal items one gets at the grocery store. Frozen food will last longer, obviously, and always having some veggies in the freezer will help you during meal preparation. Your goal in this phase should be to have the right food in your kitchen. Try to plan out healthy meals over the course of the first couple of weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook up simple recipes that can be done without thinking\\u2014start small and build up to harder recipes as your skills increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlan out different days that you will be able to take your time with a meal - you can cook everything for the week on Sunday and refrigerate it all. If you hate meal prep, set an hour aside each evening to cook your dinner.\",\n",

Once you find some things you like, bookmark the tabs or save the recipes so you'll have them later on.\",\n",

If none of your friends own dogs you can volunteer at your local animal shelter or sign up to be a dog walker on apps like Wag! and Rover, where busy people will pay you to walk their dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you hate dogs or just can't find one, find a friend to walk or jog with you\\u2014if you are inexperienced, start small with a walk around your neighborhood and build up to jogging longer and more challenging routes.\",\n",

I did not lack any physical activity and my body was\\r\\nin great shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I did not think about was the strain and beating that my knees were taking during\\r\\nthose intense sprints and long runs. The summer between high school and college I started\\r\\nto develop pain in both of my knees, which caused trouble when I tried to run 10 miles on a\\r\\nweekend as a referee. I needed a diagnosis fast so I could continue to referee and play\\r\\nsoccer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my diagnosis, I went to a local therapy and sports medicine specialist where they\\r\\ndiagnosed me with patellar tendonitis, a common problem for many athletes as they get\\r\\nolder. Patellar tendonitis weakens the patellar tendon, which aids in stabilizing the patella.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/patellar-tendonitis\\r\\n\\r\\nIn college, students should be as active and physically fit as they desire. This was not the\\r\\ncase for me originally. Patellar tendonitis had me out of commission trying to fix years of\\r\\ndamage.
