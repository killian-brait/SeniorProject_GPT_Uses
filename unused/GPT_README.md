#### Example Uses of GPT 3.5/4 Model for Personalized Experience on Trees application

1. Get Personal Message Based on Completed Questions
> Get the user's answers to the questions and feed them into a function.
> Prompt the engine: "You are going to act as a personal counselor for one {parameter | ex: student at a university}. As a personal counselor you will be trying to give this {student} a short bit of advice describing how they can best use the {university}-Tips platform for their benefit, given personal information about the student that they provide through the answers to a questionnaire. Are you ready for the answers to the questions that this user answered?"
> Ignore response to initial prompt.
> Second prompt: "Here are the user's answers that they have completed so far with information about when they answered the question this way as well as if they changed the answer from a previous answer. {q1 : {answer}, q2 : {answer}, q3: {answer}, q4: {answer}, ..., gN: {answer}}. Please provide a summary of what insights these answers can give the individual who provided the answers about themselves."
> Save the response for display to the user who just answered questions.
> Third prompt: "The {University}-Tips platform is designed to allow student success systems on campus; administrators, volunteer students, and working students to connect to their campus and the resources that are available to help students reach their full potential in this new juncture. It does this by allowing administrators to create content that is specific to the university and the lived-experiences of individuals at the specific-campus where the platform is provided. This content is viewable on the discover page of the application and interactions with this content are crucial in allowing our platforms to take advantage of modern machine learning techniques in order to build a recommender that recommends the best content for each individual. As a platform, we aren't in it for the ad money, we just want to provide the best content, unique and personalized to each individual. Now that you know a bit more about what this platform provides, and you know some more personal information about the specific student that you are currently working with, can you provide a 100-200 word description of how this student can best use the application, the types of content that they would find the most useful and encourage them to spend some time trying to follow some of the plans in the content that teach them how to better make use of campus resources?"
> Save the response and show it to the user - immediate personalization.
> Costs: All of the above lines are 407 words. With a filled out dictionary of 50 questions, I'd say we would get up to ~7000 words max. Each prompt will likely return ~50-300 words, let's estimate ~1000 words of output as a conservative estimate. This means that we need ~10K tokens of input, and ~1.5K tokens of output. With GPT-3.5-turbo model at 16K context, that is $0.03 for the input and $0.006 for the output, totalling $0.036 per user, conservatively. If 100,000 user's do this action, it would cost ~$3,600 as currently described. Which illustrates that while this is a novel and interesting use of AI to improve the user experience on the platform, it is also a costly approach if not implemented with more detail and care for minimizing costs.
